# CarlXRemotePowerShell
a process and a set of PowerShell Remote functions that in combination perform the install via the CarlX installer. The PowerShell source and instructions are sanitized for distribution outside FCPL. A CSV file contains the machine names for the upgrade targets, generated by an inventory utility. A small set of PCs represents a good starting list. Current versions of the PowerShell Remote command functions have the names:
CarlCreateFilePath
CarlFileCopy
CarlScheduleTask
CarlVersionCheck
Basically, the whole goal is to kick off CarlX.exe. It's vital that you can do this "silently", otherwise there will be interaction needed from the user. The other requirement is that CarlX.ini is preexisting. When performing upgrades this isn't an issue since it will detect the file that's there, but on new machines you need to create the file path and copy over the ini file. I have to do this when using Intune. Like I said, this only applies to the Staff client, I'm not able to target ITSI or Admin individually, but the upgrade of Staff.exe will affect them if they're already on the system. The commands to kick it off are (Admin privileges needed):
Command Prompt:  filepath\CarlX.exe /VerySilent
PowerShell: Start-Process -FilePath "filepath\CarlX.exe" -ArgumentList "/VerySilent" -Wait (edited)
